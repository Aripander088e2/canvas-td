Todo:

* More responsive wave bar.
* Examine turret targeting.
* Confirm selling turrets.
* Fast forward.
* Optimize collision detection/tiling, e.g. only check edges, + more.
* Better icon and promo graphics.
* Audio.
* Random map.
* Canvas TD Sever.
* Offline.
* Bug: Turrets being placed (that haven't been bought yet) can be upgraded through keyboard shortcuts. Hilariousness ensues.
