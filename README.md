Todo:

* Redo turret targeting.
* Confirm selling turrets.
* Optimize collision detection/tiling, e.g. only check edges, + more.
* Better icon and promo graphics.
* Audio effects.
* Random map generator.
* Canvas TD Sever.
* Offline support.
* Bug: Turrets being placed (that haven't been bought yet) can be upgraded through keyboard shortcuts. Hilariousness ensues.
